# Data Structures From Scratch (Python)

This repository contains fundamental data structures implemented from scratch using Python.
The goal of this project is to build strong core CS concepts and maintain consistent GitHub activity.

---

## Day 1: Core Data Structures
- Array operations (insert, delete, search, display)
- Stack implementation using array
- Queue implementation using array

---

## Day 2: Linked Lists & Trees
- Singly Linked List implementation
- Binary Tree traversals (Inorder, Preorder, Postorder)

---

## Day 3: Stack & Queue Applications
- Parenthesis checking using stack
- Infix to Postfix conversion
- Postfix expression evaluation

---

## Day 4: Sorting & Searching
- Bubble Sort
- Merge Sort
- Binary Search
- Time complexity understanding (O(n²), O(n log n), O(log n))

---

## Day 5: Recursion & Backtracking
- Factorial using recursion
- Fibonacci using recursion
- N-Queens problem (Backtracking)

---

## Day 6: Graph Algorithms
- Graph representation using adjacency list
- Breadth First Search (BFS)
- Depth First Search (DFS)
